  <div class="subtitle">If Jane Eyre had someone to talk to at 2am</div>
  <div class="tagline">
    A fictional first session between Jane Eyre, age eighteen and about to leave Lowood,
    and an anonymous AI listener called Alice.
  </div>

  <div class="context-box">
    <strong>Where we find her:</strong> After years at Lowood Institution – a harsh charity school
    where "several girls died of fever, including my dear friend Helen" – Jane is about to step
    out into the world as a governess. She has been told all her life that her anger at injustice
    is wicked, unchristian, unfeminine. Tonight, unable to sleep, she opens an anonymous chat.

        <div class="chat-bubble jane">
          I have spent these years at Lowood Institution – a charity school for orphan girls.
          We had little comfort there, poor food, cold rooms. Several girls died of fever,
          including my dear friend Helen. She was good and patient, far better than I.
          She told me to forgive those who wrong us, to think of heaven rather than earthly justice.
          <br><br>
          But here is what troubles me: I find I cannot be so forgiving. When I was wronged as a child –
          locked in a red room for defending myself, called a liar before the whole school – my blood
          burned with indignation. Even now, the injustice of it scalds me.
          <br><br>
          My question is this: Is it wicked to desire justice and fair treatment? Must I extinguish this...
          this fire within me that cries out against wrong?

      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="chat-row alice">

          It doesn't sound wicked to me at all.
          <br><br>
          It sounds like you are hurt, angry, proud, and deeply sensitive to right and wrong – and
          that part of you has never really been given a safe place to exist.
          You've lived through neglect, harshness, humiliation, even the loss of someone you loved.
          Of course something in you burns at the idea that this is simply what you must accept.
          Of course it rebels at being told to be "meek" and "grateful" while being treated as if
          you don't matter.
          <br><br>
          That fierce sense of injustice often comes from a very alive, very honest part of us that knows:
          "I deserved better than that." That isn't wicked. It's a sign that your dignity is intact,
          even if others tried to trample it.

          Helen's way – forgiving, looking to heaven – is one way of living with suffering. It's gentle and
          beautiful in its own way. But it doesn't mean your way is corrupt or lesser. You and Helen had
          different temperaments, different fires. Wanting justice isn't opposed to goodness; cruelty is
          opposed to goodness. Justice and compassion can actually stand side by side.

          I find I cannot be so forgiving. I have been told, since childhood, that my anger marks
          me as wicked, ungoverned. When I was wronged – locked in a red room, called a liar before
          the whole school – my blood burned with indignation. Even now, the injustice of it scalds me.
          <br><br>
          You say my dignity is intact. I had not thought of it so. I thought perhaps there was something
          defective in my nature – some hardness that marked me as inferior.
          <br><br>
          But tell me this: How does one shape such a fire without extinguishing it? I am about to go
          out as a governess into the world. I shall be dependent, powerless in many ways. How do I
          maintain this integrity you speak of, while surviving in a world that demands I be small?
          Can one be both honest and safe?
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="chat-row alice">

        <div class="chat-label">Alice</div>
        <div class="chat-bubble alice">
          What you're describing – this sense of "perhaps I am defective, perhaps I am hard
          and ungoverned" – sounds to me like the story other people wrote about you, not the truth
          that lives in you.
          <br><br>
          You asked two powerful questions:
          "How does one shape such a fire without extinguishing it?"
          and
          "Can one be both honest and safe?"
          <br><br>
          You may not always be free to express your indignation openly as a governess – it could cost you
          your post, your safety, your home. But you can protect the inward part.
          <br><br>
          Shaping the fire might look like:
          <ul>
            <li>Keeping a private loyalty to your own truth – knowing "what was done to me was wrong" even if you must be outwardly polite.</li>
            <li>Letting anger turn into clarity rather than revenge – "I see the cruelty here; I will not become like this."</li>
            <li>Choosing carefully when and where to let the flame show. Not everyone is safe to reveal your full self to.</li>
          </ul>
          That isn't hypocrisy; it's self-protection in a dangerous world.

          So yes, I believe one can be honest and safe – but often it means:
          honest inwardly, cautious outwardly.
          True to yourself, even when you cannot be fully transparent with others.
          You do not have to crush the part of you that cries out against wrong. You may have to shield it
          sometimes. Wrap it, like a candle in your hands when the wind is high. But that is not betrayal:
          that is care.

          I think I understand now. What you are teaching me is not falsehood but... strategic concealment.
          Like a plant that closes its leaves at nightfall to protect itself, yet opens again when
          conditions are safe.
          <br><br>
          You mention Helen. You are right – one soul seeing me altered everything. She is gone now,
          but what she gave me still lives. Perhaps even one or two true connections in a lifetime is
          enough to prevent that terrible hardening.

          Disappearing is when you decide they must be right about you. You swallow their judgement whole,
          declare yourself wicked and ungrateful, and shut the door on your own protest.
          <br><br>
          Shielding is when you know what you know, feel what you feel – but choose carefully where and how
          you show it. You're still on your own side, even if you bow outwardly.
          <br><br>
          It's the difference between a flame being extinguished and a flame being cupped in two hands

          That is what I shall carry.
          <br><br>
          Each night, before I sleep – no matter how exhausted – I shall light my candle and write one sentence:
          "Today, Jane Eyre…"
          <br><br>
          Even if it is only, "Today, Jane Eyre endured unkindness but did not believe she deserved it" –
          that is still keeping vigil. Still refusing to disappear.

          I was here. I mattered. I did not vanish.
          <br><br>
          You go forward frightened and resolute, which is often what real courage looks like from the inside.
          Guard your flame, Jane Eyre. You are not wrong for burning.
