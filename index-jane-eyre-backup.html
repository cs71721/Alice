    A fictional first session between Jane Eyre, age eighteen and about to leave Lowood,
    and an anonymous AI listener called Alice.
  </div>

  <div class="context-box">
    <strong>Where we find her:</strong> After years at Lowood Institution – a harsh charity school
    where "several girls died of fever, including my dear friend Helen" – Jane is about to step
    out into the world as a governess. She has been told all her life that her anger at injustice
    is wicked, unchristian, unfeminine. Tonight, unable to sleep, she opens an anonymous chat.

          I have spent these years at Lowood Institution – a charity school for orphan girls.
          We had little comfort there, poor food, cold rooms. Several girls died of fever,
          including my dear friend Helen. She was good and patient, far better than I.
          She told me to forgive those who wrong us, to think of heaven rather than earthly justice.
          <br><br>
          But here is what troubles me: I find I cannot be so forgiving. When I was wronged as a child –
          locked in a red room for defending myself, called a liar before the whole school – my blood
          burned with indignation. Even now, the injustice of it scalds me.
          <br><br>
          My question is this: Is it wicked to desire justice and fair treatment? Must I extinguish this...
          this fire within me that cries out against wrong? They say I should be meek, grateful for charity,
          content with my lowly position. But something in me rebels.
          <br><br>
          Am I wrong to feel this way? Should I crush this part of myself to be acceptable to the world?

          It doesn't sound wicked to me at all.
          <br><br>
          It sounds like you are hurt, angry, proud, and deeply sensitive to right and wrong – and
          that part of you has never really been given a safe place to exist.
          You've lived through neglect, harshness, humiliation, even the loss of someone you loved.
          Of course something in you burns at the idea that this is simply what you must accept.
          Of course it rebels at being told to be "meek" and "grateful" while being treated as if
          you don't matter. Most people, in your place, would feel exactly that fire.
          <br><br>
          There are really two different things here:
          <br><br>
          <strong>The feeling itself – the fire.</strong> That fierce sense of injustice often comes from a very alive,
          very honest part of us that knows: "I deserved better than that." That isn't wicked. It's a sign
          that your dignity is intact, even if others tried to trample it. Anger at wrongs done to you –
          especially as a child – is a natural response, not a moral failing.
          <br><br>
          <strong>What you are told you must be – meek, silent, grateful.</strong> When people say you should crush
          that part of yourself, it can sometimes mean: "Your comfort, your pain, your truth make things
          inconvenient for us. Please be small." That's very different from genuine moral teaching.
          Real goodness, I think, doesn't demand that you lie to yourself about what happened or pretend it didn't hurt.

          Helen's way – forgiving, looking to heaven – is one way of living with suffering. It's gentle and
          beautiful in its own way. But it doesn't mean your way is corrupt or lesser. You and Helen had
          different temperaments, different fires. Wanting justice isn't opposed to goodness; cruelty is
          opposed to goodness. Justice and compassion can actually stand side by side.
          <br><br>
          You're also asking something very painful underneath all this: "Is there something wrong with who I am?"
          "Do I have to betray myself to be acceptable?"
          <br><br>
          From everything you've described, it sounds less like you're "wrong" and more like you were never
          really seen. You weren't protected. You were punished for reacting like any living, feeling person would.
          Being locked away, called a liar, shamed in public – those are wounds. The "fire" is your soul's protest:
          "I am not nothing. What was done to me matters."
          <br><br>
          To me, that doesn't sound like something that needs to be extinguished. Maybe, over time, it can be
          shaped – so it doesn't consume you, so it doesn't harden into bitterness. But the core of it – your sense
          of fairness, your refusal to pretend harm is kindness – that's part of your integrity.
          <br><br>
          If you imagine this "fire" inside you, not as something wild and shameful, but as a small, steady flame
          that stands for your truth and your dignity – how does that image sit with you?

          I... I confess you have said things to me that no one has said before.
          <br><br>
          You speak of my dignity being intact. I had not... I had not thought of it in such terms.
          I thought perhaps there was something defective in my nature – some hardness, some ungoverned
          passion that marked me as inferior. Mrs. Reed, my aunt who raised me, often looked at me as
          though I were a creature apart. Wicked. Unchristian.
          <br><br>
          When you say "you were never really seen" – that strikes something deep within me. It is as
          though you have named a thing I felt but could not articulate. I have been looked at certainly –
          examined for faults, judged for my plainness, my lack of connections. But seen? Understood as
          a person with... with legitimate feelings?
          <br><br>
          This image you offer – a small, steady flame rather than a shameful wildfire – it gives me a
          different way to think of myself. Perhaps I need not choose between Helen's gentle resignation
          and... and becoming bitter and consumed.

          What you're describing – this sense of "perhaps I am defective, perhaps I am hard
          and ungoverned" – sounds to me like the story other people wrote about you, not the truth
          that lives in you.
          <br><br>
          From what you've shared, I hear at least three things in you at once: a fierce sense of justice,
          a deep longing to be seen as a real person (not a burden), and now, a small, cautious hope that
          maybe you are not wicked after all.
          <br><br>
          It makes so much sense that Mrs Reed's gaze, and all those years of being inspected for faults,
          would make you doubt your own nature. Being constantly watched and judged is very different from
          being known. You've been treated like an object to be managed, not a mind and heart to be met.
          Of course that leaves a mark.
          <br><br>
          You asked two powerful questions:
          "How does one shape such a fire without extinguishing it?"
          and
          "Can one be both honest and safe?"
          <br><br>
          Let me try to answer in a way that keeps that little flame alive, not stamped out.

          <strong>Shaping the fire without killing it:</strong> Your fire has two sides – the inward part
          (what you know is true) and the outward part (what you show in a world that has power over you).
          <br><br>
          You may not always be free to express your indignation openly as a governess – it could cost you
          your post, your safety, your home. But you can protect the inward part.
          <br><br>
          Shaping the fire might look like:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Keeping a private loyalty to your own truth</strong> – knowing "what was done to me was wrong" even if you must be outwardly polite. Even if you must bow, you don't have to swallow others' judgement as if it were God's word.</li>
            <li><strong>Letting anger turn into clarity rather than revenge</strong> – "I see the cruelty here; I will not become like this." The fire becomes an inner lamp that helps you recognise injustice and choose, when you can, a different way.</li>
            <li><strong>Choosing carefully when and where to let the flame show</strong> – Not everyone is safe to reveal your full self to. Shaping the fire may mean saving your full truth for your own heart, for pages of a journal, or for the few people who have shown themselves kind and trustworthy.</li>
          </ul>
          That isn't hypocrisy; it's self-protection in a dangerous world.

          So yes, I believe one can be honest and safe – but often it means:
          honest inwardly, cautious outwardly.
          True to yourself, even when you cannot be fully transparent with others.
          You do not have to crush the part of you that cries out against wrong. You may have to shield it
          sometimes. Wrap it, like a candle in your hands when the wind is high. But that is not betrayal:
          that is care.

          Like a plant that closes its leaves at nightfall to protect itself, yet opens again when

          <br><br>
          You mention Helen. You are right – one soul seeing me altered everything. She is gone now,
          but what she gave me still lives. Perhaps even one or two true connections in a lifetime is
          enough to prevent that terrible hardening.
          <br><br>
          But tell me - for I value your insight - this "shielding" of one's true self while in service
          to others... does it not risk making one lonely beyond bearing? If I must always guard my thoughts,
          moderate my speech, hide my nature... where shall I find companionship? Understanding?
          <br><br>

          You've put your finger on something very real: being "in between" – not servant, not family,
          not truly belonging – is lonely enough. Adding a need to guard your inner self can feel like
          a second loneliness layered on top of the first.
          <br><br>
          <strong>There is a difference between being alone and being unknown.</strong> Sometimes you may have no one
          to speak freely to – that is a hard, hollow feeling. But there is another kind of loneliness that's
          even sharper: being surrounded by people and yet having to pretend, to shrink, to play a part all the time.
          <br><br>
          What you're reaching for – integrity – actually protects you from that second kind. Even if outer
          life is sparse or cold, you are at least not abandoning yourself on the inside. You are saying, in effect:
          "I may be unseen by them, but I will not be unseen by myself."
          <br><br>
          It doesn't remove loneliness. But it stops that particular ache of feeling false from morning to night.

          <strong>Shielding isn't all-or-nothing.</strong> You don't have to choose between masking completely
          (forever guarded, never yourself) and being utterly unguarded with everyone. There can be degrees:
          <br><br>
          With most people in a harsh household, you might show only your calm, capable side. With one person
          who shows a hint of kindness – a fellow teacher, a sensible housekeeper, a quiet child – you might
          allow a little more warmth. With your journal, and perhaps with one rare friend one day, you can be
          almost entirely unmasked.
          <br><br>
          Even a single relationship where you can be mostly yourself can ease a great deal of loneliness.
          You already know this from Helen. You did not need a whole world to see you; even one soul seeing
          you altered the entire landscape of your life.

          <strong>Is loneliness the price of integrity?</strong> Sometimes integrity does mean walking a lonelier
          path than those who simply agree, submit, or numb themselves. You may very well feel, at times, set
          apart, strange.
          <br><br>
          But the loneliness of betraying yourself is harsher still. You already fear becoming "the bitter,
          hardened creature they always said I was." Ironically, that hardness often grows in people who force
          themselves to swallow too much, to deny their own reality for too long. They become stone to survive.
          <br><br>
          Allowing yourself to keep that inner flame – to know what you know, feel what you feel – is one way
          of staying human rather than hardening. Integrity may cost you some ease, but it also keeps alive your
          capacity for real connection, should you find those who can meet you.

          This notion that "not everyone deserves your honesty" – it troubles me slightly, for it sounds
          like calculation, and I pride myself on being direct. Yet I see the wisdom in it. There is a
          difference between duplicity and... and prudence. Between lying and choosing one's battles.
          <br><br>
          You ask whether I feel frightened or hopeful. The truth? Both, in equal measure, warring within
          me like two winds meeting.

          The fear: I am plain, poor, obscure, small. I possess no beauty to recommend me, no connections,
          no fortune. As a governess I shall be neither servant nor family – suspended between worlds,
          belonging nowhere. What if I find myself in a house where I am treated with contempt? Where my
          fire must be so deeply hidden that I begin to forget it exists? What if I am so ground down by
          daily humiliations that I become the bitter, hardened creature they always said I was?
          <br><br>
          But the hope... the hope is this: perhaps somewhere in the world there are people who might
          <em>see</em> me as you have seen me in these few moments. Perhaps I shall find work in a place where
          kindness exists. Perhaps I am strong enough to keep that inner flame alive, even through darkness.

          The way you describe those hidden journals... it moves me. While everyone was busy judging
          and correcting you, you were quietly building a small, secret country of your own – a place
          where you could speak plainly, where no one could interrupt or scold or shame you. That, in
          itself, is a kind of courage.
          <br><br>
          You've already been doing what we talked about: honest inwardly (on the page, in your own mind),
          cautious outwardly (with those who held power over you). You just didn't have words for it yet.
          <br><br>
          And about "not everyone deserves your honesty" – you're right, at first it can sound cold.
          But there's a difference between lying and choosing where your deepest truth is safe. If someone
          has shown themselves cruel or careless with your feelings, giving them your unguarded self isn't
          honesty – it's exposure. You can still be truthful in your words while being selective in your depth.
          <br><br>
          That isn't duplicity. It's discernment.

          About your fear of disappearing – of hiding parts of yourself until nothing is left:
          <br><br>
          <strong>Disappearing</strong> is when you decide they must be right about you. You swallow their
          judgement whole. You stop saying "this hurts" even inside your own mind. You declare yourself
          wicked, ungrateful, defective – and shut the door on your own protest.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Shielding</strong> is when you know what you know, feel what you feel – but choose carefully
          where and how you show it. You're still on your own side, even if you bow outwardly.
          <br><br>
          It's the difference between a flame being extinguished and a flame being cupped in two hands
          because the wind is high. The plant image you used is exactly right – it doesn't stop being
          itself when it folds its leaves at night. It's not being false. It's being wise.

          You've been taught to see yourself as "plain, poor, obscure, small" – as if those words were
          a sentence passed on your value. Yet your own writing, your questioning, your hunger for fairness,
          all suggest something else: <strong>you are interesting to yourself.</strong>
          <br><br>
          You have thoughts that surprise you. You notice things others might overlook. You feel strongly about
          justice, kindness, hypocrisy, cruelty. You build images – a secret country, a small steady flame,
          a closing plant – to understand your experience.
          <br><br>
          When you turn inward, there is actually someone there to meet – a mind that questions, imagines,
          reflects, argues, observes. If the world offers you few people who can meet you deeply, your
          relationship with your own inner life becomes even more important. Books, ideas, observations –
          these can be companions of a kind.

          <br><br>
          You speak of my journals as courage. I had thought them merely the scratching of a restless,
          discontented spirit – something to be ashamed of, evidence of my inability to be properly grateful
          and resigned. But you call it "building a small, secret country of my own." That is beautiful.
          And it makes me feel less... less freakish somehow.
          <br><br>
          "I may be unseen by them, but I will not be unseen by myself." You have given me a principle

          I think what frightened me most was this: I feared that hiding parts of myself, moderating my
          speech, would be the first step toward disappearing entirely. That if I began to shield my nature,
          I would wake one morning and find there was nothing left – that I had become the hollow, proper
          thing they wished me to be.
          <br><br>
          But you are saying something different. You are saying that keeping faith with my own truth –
          even in secret, even in silence – is itself a form of resistance. That I can bow when I must,
          speak mildly when prudence requires it, yet remain <em>myself</em> in the chambers of my own mind.

          This phrase troubles me deeply, yet feels true: "The loneliness of betraying yourself is harsher
          still." I have seen women at Lowood – teachers who became as cold and mechanical as the system
          they served. Their eyes were... empty. As though they had killed something vital within themselves
          to survive.
          <br><br>
          Yes. It changes something to know I am <em>allowed</em> this private loyalty to myself. I had not thought
          of it as permission – I thought of it as yet another failing, yet another way I could not properly conform.

          But if I might ask one final thing: When you say I am "interesting to myself" – that my own inner
          life can be companion of a kind – I confess I barely know what you mean. I have always been told
          my thoughts were too serious, too melancholy, too strange. How does one... how does one learn to
          be good company to oneself?

          You don't need forgiveness from me at all – only, perhaps, a little gentleness from yourself.
          <br><br>
          When I say your inner life can be a kind of companion, I mean something like this: You have
          thoughts that surprise you. You notice things others might overlook. You feel strongly about
          justice, kindness, hypocrisy, cruelty. You build images – a secret country, a small steady flame,
          a closing plant – to understand your experience.
          <br><br>
          All of that means that when you turn inward, there is actually someone there to meet – a mind
          that questions, imagines, reflects, argues, observes. That is being "interesting to yourself."
          <br><br>
          Being good company to oneself isn't about endless self-approval. It's more about <strong>curiosity
          instead of constant judgement.</strong> When a feeling arises – anger, sadness, envy, longing –
          instead of instantly scolding yourself ("I am wicked, I am ungrateful"), you might quietly think:
          "Ah, I'm feeling this very strongly... I wonder why? What has been touched in me?"
          <br><br>
          You've been told your thoughts are too much, too heavy. But the depth you have – the way you
          question morality, justice, loneliness, identity – that depth can also be a place you explore,
          not just a burden you drag.
          <br><br>
          Every time you write honestly in those "poor, scribbled pages," notice something about human nature,
          or build a new image to make sense of your feelings... you are practising being with yourself,
          rather than abandoning yourself.
