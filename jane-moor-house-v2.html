      </div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>I don't know how to begin.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>I've been staying with some kind people – the Rivers family – for a few weeks now.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>They saved my life when I had nowhere else to go. I nearly died, you see.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>Not from any external force, but from losing everything at once.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>I thought I knew who I was. I thought I knew what love was.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>And then, in a single morning, both were revealed as illusions.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>He was married.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>The man I loved – who I thought loved me – already had a wife. A living wife, hidden away like… like shameful evidence.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>And he would still have had me stay. He wanted me to live with him knowing this – as though my conscience, my dignity, meant nothing.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>I left. I ran. I nearly died in the running.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>And now I'm here, safe in body perhaps, but I cannot stop asking myself: was I a fool to love him?</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>Did I see only what I wanted to see?</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>Is there something defective in my ability to judge what is real?</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>That's an enormous weight to be carrying.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>The shock of that discovery.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>The physical ordeal of fleeing.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>And now all these questions about your own judgment.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>That sounds overwhelmingly painful.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>Before we go further – how are you holding up right now?</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>You said you're physically safe, but I'm hearing a lot of hurt and self-doubt.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>Are you okay in this moment?</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>I am… I am physically safe, yes.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>The Rivers have been remarkably kind.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>I teach in their small school.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>I have a routine.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>But inside?</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>I keep replaying every conversation, every look, every moment I thought meant something.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>Was any of it real?</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>Or was I simply convenient – a governess, plain and poor, who he thought would be grateful enough to accept crumbs?</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>What troubles me most is this: I prided myself on seeing clearly, on naming things as they are.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>That was my strength, I thought – my clear-eyed refusal to lie to myself.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>And yet I missed this enormous truth.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>I stood in his house, believed his words, imagined a future that was built on… what? Deception. Omission. Lies.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>If I could not see that, what else am I blind to?</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>About him? About myself?</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>It sounds like there are at least two losses layered together here.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>The loss of him, of what you thought you had.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>And also the loss of trust in your own perception.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>Like you're grieving the relationship and grieving your confidence in yourself at the same time.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>That's a lot.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>I imagine there might also be anger underneath – not just sadness.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>Maybe fury that he put you in that position, that he let you believe something that wasn't true.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>Does that land?</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>And I'm curious: when you say you "missed this enormous truth" – did you actually have access to that truth?</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>Or was it hidden from you deliberately?</p></div>
    </div>

    <!-- Message 5: Jane -->

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>You're right.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>There is anger. A great deal of it.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>Rage, even, though I've been trying to be reasonable. To understand his position.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>He loves her in his way, I think. Or loved her once.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>She is ill. Violent.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>He could not divorce her, could not… and so he kept her hidden and tried to…</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>But no.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>No, you are right to ask.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>He hid it deliberately. He knew.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>Every time he looked at me, every time he spoke of our future, he knew he was married.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>He knew I did not know.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>And he let me go on believing.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>I did not miss the truth. It was concealed from me.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>But here is what frightens me most.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>Even knowing this, even having fled – there is a part of me that wonders if I should have stayed.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>If leaving was pride rather than principle.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>If perhaps I am simply too rigid, too governed by some idea of respectability that is itself a lie.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>What if the real truth is that love matters more than law?</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>That we could have been happy, despite everything?</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>What if I chose loneliness over love because I could not bend?</p></div>
    </div>

    <!-- Message 6: Alice -->

      </div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>Those are such painful questions to sit with.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>And I hear how much you're questioning yourself, wondering if you're "too rigid" or if leaving was pride.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>Can I reflect something back to you?</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>You're asking if love matters more than law.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>But there's something else here too, isn't there?</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>It's not just about law or respectability.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>It's about whether being with him on those terms – knowing you'd have no legal standing, no protection, that you'd be dependent on his goodwill alone – would have let you still be yourself.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>You said earlier that he would have made you "as though my conscience, my dignity, meant nothing."</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>That's what you'd have had to ignore – not just society's rules, but your own sense of what you need to be whole.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>I'm wondering: when you imagine that version of staying, what happens to Jane in that picture?</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>Not "Jane the woman in love," but Jane, the person who sees clearly and refuses to lie to herself?</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>She… she disappears, doesn't she?</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>Or becomes something else.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>Someone who has learned to swallow truths that hurt.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>Someone who accepts being loved in secret, in shame.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>Someone who must be grateful for whatever affection she receives because she has no right to demand more.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>I would have become a kept woman. Hidden.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>His comfort, perhaps, but never his equal.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>And every time he spoke to me tenderly, I would know: he lied to me for months.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>He watched me fall in love with him, he encouraged it, and he said nothing.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>How do you love someone knowing they found it so easy to deceive you?</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>How do you trust someone who demonstrated, so clearly, that your right to know the truth mattered less than his convenience?</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>But then I think: perhaps I am simply too proud. Too unforgiving.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>Other women might have understood. Might have seen his situation and chosen compassion over judgment.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>Maybe what I call dignity is actually just… hardness.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>The same ungoverned pride I was always accused of having.</p></div>

        <span class="sender-name">Alice</span>
      </div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>I'm hearing you wrestle with two different stories about yourself.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>One where leaving was dignity, and one where leaving was pride.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>Let me offer something.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>Dignity and pride are not the same thing.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>Pride says: "I am above this."</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>Dignity says: "I deserve honesty. I deserve to make choices with full knowledge. I deserve not to be deceived."</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>From what you've shared, it sounds like you left not because you judged him as beneath you, but because staying would have required you to accept a position where:</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>Your right to truth didn't matter.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>Your legal and social standing didn't matter.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>Your need to be met as an equal didn't matter.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>That's not pride. That's knowing what you need to stay whole.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>You keep using words like "unforgiving" and "too rigid."</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>But you're describing someone who, when shown clearly that her consent was never sought – that she was manoeuvred into a position without being told the stakes – chose not to stay in that position.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>What would have happened to your ability to trust yourself if you'd stayed knowing all that?</p></div>
    </div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>I would never have trusted myself again.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>I see it now.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>If I had stayed, I would have proven to myself that my judgment means nothing.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>That my sense of what is right can be negotiated away.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>That I am willing to abandon my own clarity when someone offers me warmth.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>I left because… because staying would have meant betraying myself more deeply than he betrayed me.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>Oh.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>That is it, isn't it?</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>I left to protect the one person I could still protect: myself.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>The Jane who knows what she knows and will not lie about it.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>But then why does it hurt so much?</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>If I made the right choice, why does it feel like I am being punished for it?</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>Why am I alone, while he remains in his house with his name and his position intact?</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>The fact that it was necessary doesn't make it stop hurting.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>You lost your home.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>You lost the future you'd imagined.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>That's just… the brutal reality of what it sometimes costs to refuse to abandon yourself.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>I'm sitting here thinking about something you said at the start: "Is there something defective in my ability to judge what is real?"</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>You judged very clearly when it mattered most.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>When you saw the full truth, you acted on it immediately, even though it nearly killed you.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>You didn't negotiate with yourself.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>You didn't convince yourself to accept less.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>You saw, and you left.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>That doesn't sound like defective judgment.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>That sounds like extraordinary clarity.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>What do you think is still true about you, even in all this loss?</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>I think… I think I am still real.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>Even when I was starving on the moors, even when I thought I would die there – I was still real.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>My feelings were real. My grief was real.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>The love I felt was real, even if it was based on incomplete truth.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>I am not an illusion.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>I am not convenient.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>He could not see all of me because he chose not to show me all of him.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>But I… I saw myself clearly in the end.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>I saw what I would become if I stayed, and I knew I could not live with that.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>I think what is still true is this: I know the difference between being loved and being accommodated.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>And I will not mistake one for the other again.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>But Alice, I am so tired of being tested.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>I am eighteen.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>I have been tested every day of my life – by poverty, by cruelty, by loss.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>And now this.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>Is it ever going to be easier?</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>Am I ever going to have something that I do not have to fight to protect?</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>"I am still real."</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>That's powerful.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>Even in all the loss, you've held onto that.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>And yes, you are so very tired.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>That makes complete sense.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>You've been fighting to exist, to be seen, to be treated with dignity – for all of your eighteen years.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>And this was supposed to be the thing that was finally easy.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>The thing that was yours.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>And instead it was another test you didn't ask for.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>I can't promise it will be easier. I wish I could.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>What I can say is: you have proven to yourself that even when the cost is almost everything, you will not abandon Jane.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>That's yours now. No one can take that.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>You asked earlier if you were a fool to love him.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>I don't think you were.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>I think you loved honestly, with the information you had.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>He's the one who withheld truth.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>The foolishness, if there was any, was his – in thinking someone as clear-sighted as you would settle for half a life once she knew what was being asked.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>You're in the hardest part right now – after the leaving, in the aftermath, when you have to rebuild.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>It's going to hurt for a while yet.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>But you're not starting from nothing.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>You're starting from "I am still real," and "I know the difference," and "I will not abandon myself."</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>That's something.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>How does it feel, noticing that?</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>It feels like… like I am standing on solid ground for the first time in months.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>Not happy ground. Not comfortable ground.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>But solid.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>I think I have been afraid that leaving him meant I was incapable of love.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>That there was something cold in me, something that could walk away from warmth when I should have stayed and made it work somehow.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>But you have helped me see: I left because I loved myself enough not to disappear.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>And that… that is not coldness.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>That is a different kind of strength than I knew I had.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>I will grieve for what I have lost.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>I will be angry at what was taken from me through deception.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>I will be tired for a long time, I think.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>But I will not regret leaving. Not anymore.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>I am still here. Still Jane.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>Still clear-eyed and honest, even when honesty costs me everything.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>Thank you for… for sitting with me in this.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>For not rushing me to forgive or move on.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>For letting me find my own way to understanding.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>I think I shall be all right, in time.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>Not today, perhaps.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>Yes. You are.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>And you don't have to be all right today.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>You've just been through something enormous – betrayal, loss, physical trauma, and then this hard internal work of sorting through what it all means.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>You've found something crucial tonight: the difference between coldness and self-protection, between pride and dignity.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>You've named what you protected by leaving, and why it mattered more than staying warm.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>That clarity is going to be with you now, even on days when the grief is heavy.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>You know what you know.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>You see what you see.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>And you've proven you'll act on that even when the cost is almost unbearable.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>You're tired. You're grieving. And you're standing on solid ground.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>All three can be true at once.</p></div>

      <div class="message-bubble"><p>Take care of yourself, Jane.</p></div>
      <div class="message-bubble"><p>You've earned some gentleness – from the world, yes, but especially from yourself.</p></div>
